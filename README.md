# School District Analysis

The purpose of the challenge was to analyze given school and student data for the school district. This would aid the district in making sound decisions regarding budget and other priorities.

# Challenge Overview
After completeing the initial analysis, it was descovered by the school district that standardized test results from the 9th graders at Thomas High School had been altered. Therefore, it was my responsibility to remove the altered data and complete the analysis with the updates. Instead of removing all 9th graders from Thomas High School completely, it was decided to substitute their math and reading scores with "NaN", representing "Not-a-Number". Altogether, 461 students had altered data.
